1. Video Capture
2. Setup: A webcam is connected, and a capture object is created using OpenCV's cv2.VideoCapture().
3. Frame Extraction: Each frame from the video feed is retrieved for further processing.
4. Frame Processing: Frames are converted to RGB or HSV color space for image processing.
5. Hand Detection and Tracking
6. Colour-based Segmentation: Isolate the hand from the background using HSV color space to identify skin tones.
7. Thresholding: Apply a threshold to create a binary mask.
8. Morphological Operations: Use erosion and dilation to remove noise and fill gaps.
9. Contour Detection: Detect contours using cv2.findContours().
10. Contour Analysis: Select the largest contour by area to represent the hand.
11. Bounding Box and Convex Hull: Generate a bounding box or convex hull around the contour to track the handâ€™s position and shape.
12. Gesture Recognition
13. Distance Measurement: Measure the distance between the thumb and index finger tips to determine volume level.
14. Finger Counting: Count visible fingers in the contour for different volume controls.-
15. Angle Measurement: Measure angles between specific hand points for more complex gestures.
16. Volume Adjustment
17. Integration with System Commands: Use platform-specific methods to adjust volume (e.g., pycaw for Windows).
18. Volume Scaling: Define a function to map gestures to volume levels for smooth transitions.
19. Real-time Feedback: Provide immediate feedback to the user via visual indicators, audio cues, or on-screen displays.
