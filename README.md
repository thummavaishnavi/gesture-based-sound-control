1. Video Capture
Setup: A webcam is connected, and a capture object is created using OpenCV's cv2.VideoCapture().
Frame Extraction: Each frame from the video feed is retrieved for further processing.
Frame Processing: Frames are converted to RGB or HSV color space for image processing.
3. Hand Detection and Tracking
Colour-based Segmentation: Isolate the hand from the background using HSV color space to identify skin tones.
Thresholding: Apply a threshold to create a binary mask.
Morphological Operations: Use erosion and dilation to remove noise and fill gaps.
Contour Detection: Detect contours using cv2.findContours().
Contour Analysis: Select the largest contour by area to represent the hand.
Bounding Box and Convex Hull: Generate a bounding box or convex hull around the contour to track the handâ€™s position and shape.
4. Gesture Recognition
Distance Measurement: Measure the distance between the thumb and index finger tips to determine volume level.
Finger Counting: Count visible fingers in the contour for different volume controls.
Angle Measurement: Measure angles between specific hand points for more complex gestures.
5. Volume Adjustment
Integration with System Commands: Use platform-specific methods to adjust volume (e.g., pycaw for Windows).
Volume Scaling: Define a function to map gestures to volume levels for smooth transitions.
Real-time Feedback: Provide immediate feedback to the user via visual indicators, audio cues, or on-screen displays.
